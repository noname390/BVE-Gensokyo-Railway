## Introduction
The Gensokyo Railway is a fictional railway system developed by me and the contributors. It is an imaginary railway system located in Gensokyo of the Touhou Project. The development of this simulated route was based on the real-life railway system in the Shinetsu region of Japan, which is believed by some to be the area where Gensokyo exists.<br>
If you are not familiar with the Touhou Project, you can also enjoy it as a general fictional railway.
Currently, the simulated line operates in one direction from the Hakurei Shrine to the Moriya Shrine on the Loop Line, but it will be extended in the future and eventually become a loop line.Other routes will also be added.
